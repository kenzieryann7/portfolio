## About me
<img class="img-border" src="media/updated-pic.jpg">

I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University in 2023, starting my journey in 2018 with a focus on web development. My passion lies in coding and creating interactive web applications. I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and other technologies. Even with five years of experience, I am continually seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and embrace new technologies.

My introduction to coding began in high school through my involvement in FIRST Robotics (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), where I served as the lead programmer. This role, which was largely self-taught, sparked my fascination with the endless possibilities that coding offers. Robotics opened many doors for me and solidified my passion for technology.

In my free time, I enjoy developing simple browser games, which has taught me to approach problem-solving with an open mind. The diversity of game types has shown me that there's always more than one way to tackle a problem, which is a big part of why I love being a developer. Beyond coding, I have a deep appreciation for the outdoors, writing, and gaming.

## Outreach

### Intel Coding Assistant

I volunteered with an Intel reach out program within my school district that teaches 4th and 5th grade girls how to code through fun activities using a site called **[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about)**. Scratch is a block-based visual programming language made to help children understand the fundamentals of coding. I believe that this experience helped me better understand the basics of coding because teaching code brings a different perspective of learning.

### Robotics Mentor/Volunteer

My involvement with FIRST Robotics has also brought an abundance of volunteering opportunities. I worked alongside with our elementary and middle school robotics teams as a code mentor. I helped them in the development process of basic coding and help them identify issues by debugging. I also was a volunteer for their competitions that were affiliated with FIRST, helping all competing teams with code debugging and any questions they may of have.
